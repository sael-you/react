<h1>First assignment for the "React - The Complete Guide" course</h1>
<p>In this assignment We explore both the basics of component creation, the state and props, as well as event handling.</p>
<h2>So what does this do?</h2>
<p>This application presents to the user a series of card like "UserOutputs" with a salutation to the given username (props.username).</p>
<p>It also gives the user a "UserInput", the user input allows the user to change the name being displayed in the first card.</p>
<h2>How can I see this in action?</h2>
<p>Just run "npm start" from the project's root folder. A browser window with the application should pop up shortly after.</p>
<h2>What was the assignment anyway?</h2>
<p>The assignment was defined by our instructor as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput</li>
<li>UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs</li>
<li>Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)</li>
<li>Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there</li>
<li>Add state to the App component (=&gt; the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component</li>
<li>Add a method to manipulate the state (=&gt; an event-handler method)</li>
<li>Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event</li>
<li>Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput</li>
<li>Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username</li>
<li>Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets</li>
</ol>
